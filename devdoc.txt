possible tests:
- purging old heads
- quadtree vs brute force
- compute shader vs cpu




Chunk-Based Generation:

Algorithm Zero: Grid-based chunk and road layout
 -> randomise positions for less uniform results?

Algorithm One: Wave Function Collapse
 -> use voronoi to create parcels, perform wfc starting from edges as given seeds

Algorithm Two: Seeded Border Generation
 -> generate common points along chunk borders to begin as seeds for generation

Algorithm Three: Parcel Subdivision
 -> divide chunks recursively into parcels, similar to alg one
